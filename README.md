## Introduction

Internal Media Microservices

This collection of scripts, microservices, and documentation supplements the CUNY TV library's public microservice collection that's under development at https://github.com/mediamicroservices/mm. Note that the CUNY TV library also makes regular use of other collaborative repositories such as https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord and https://github.com/amiaopensource/ltopers.

## Contents

### bxf2pb

A custom translator to convert BXF scheduling metadata to a proprietary XML format developed by Pebble Beach. The translator incorporates may customizations to optimization exchanges of scheduling metadata within CUNY TV.

### storagereport

`storagereport` is a bash script that assesses online and offline file collections, as well as ProTrack records, lto inventories, and scheduling data in order to guide file migration and retention in a broadcast environment. 

### youtube delivery
#### ftpscan
This script is intended to scan a folder for newly uploaded files and then upload those files to youtube automatically. To enable a show to be automatically uploaded, you need to add that prefix to the script. To do this, ssh to archivesx@10.10.200.28. Then type in terminal: nano /usr/local/bin/ftpscan. Scroll down to the list of prefixes and edit or add a prefix. Exit out of nano and answer yes to save. Then press enter. After you edit this, you then need to edit the bash script as well. Then commit your changes in github. 

### ingestremote.py
August 27, 2025

Field footage is brought to the library by videographers on XQD cards (most common), solid state drives (radio recordings), SXS cards, and iPhones. 

The script is designed to handle multiple volumes that are mounted at the same time, as well as multiple volumes that need to be mounted sequentially in the event the number of cards from a shoot exceed the number of card readers.

The ingest processs:

1. Transfers media to the desktop in archival package format
2. Runs makewindow, makemetadata, and makechecksumpackage on that package
3. Transfers the archival package to CUNYTVMEDIA
4. Tranfers the delivery package to TIGERVOLUME
5. Uploads delivery package to Dropbox (and notifies library and any designated recipients)
6. Uploads the windowdub to Resourcespace
7. Sends email report to library in the event of errors
8. Fixity check is run at every point where file is transferred

The package names follow this format:
- SHOWCODEYYYYMMDD_DESCRIPTION_OF_SHOOT
- LTNS20250827_TINABETH_TOSSES

The files from cards/drives are nested in subfolders that are named after the physical labels on the cards/drives:
- L14
- 235
- CAM_4

An archival package bifurcates audiovisual media and metadata. It is structured in this way:
- PACKAGENAME -> "objects" -> CARD# -> media
- PACKAGENAME -> "metadata" -> "logs" -> CARD# -> metadata

A delivery package is a flat file structure which contains only media files:
- PACKAGENAME -> video.mp4 & video.mp4 ...

The ingest process comprises the following scripts. Some the helper scripts can be helpful for other coding projects:

`ingestremote.py`

This script initializes the program and primarily calls other scripts to do the bulk of the process.

`detectrecentlyinserteddrives.py`

A helper script that detects drives that were mounted in the past minute. This short time window is so that you can prompt parallel ingests for different packages.

This script can be run as a main program.

`cunymediaids.py`

A helper script that lists show names and their show codes. It includes functions print_media_dict, check_similarity($string) ((should be renamed find_best_match)), and get_full_show_name($code).

`validateuserinput.py`

A helper script that the sanitizes* and/or validates:
- Package names*
- Card names*
- Emails
- File paths

* Sanitize = all capitals and spaces replaced by underscores

`sendnetworkmail.py`

A class that simplifies sending network emails. This only works when sending emails to tv.cuny.edu addresses.

- email = SendNetworkEmail()
- email.sender($string)
- email.recipients([array])
- email.subject($string)
- email.html_content($string)
- email.attachment($file_path)
- email.embed_img($img_path)
- email.send()

This script can be run as a main program.

`detectiphone.py`

Detects connected iPhone(s) using command line. 

This script can be run as a main program.

`downloadlatestiphonemedia.scpt` (BETA)

Recording remote footage on iPhone has become increasingly common. The problem is that these devices don't mount like volumes and are not programatically accessible. 

There was an open source project called libimobiledevice which reverse-engineered apple protocals, but has stopped working since iOS ~10.

The Apple application ImageCapture used to have an API, but that has been deprecated around 2022-2024, macOS Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia.

As a short term solution, this is an AppleScript which controls ImageCapture through its UI. It's awkward, and may not work well. This was coded with the assistance of UI Browser, since Apple has also deprecated the AppleScript dictionary for ImageCapture.

The script downloads the latest photo/video and all other photos/videos from the same date to an intermediary location in the Pictures/Iphone_Ingest_Temp folder. 

This script can be run as a main program.

`restructurepackage.py`

This script can restructure folders while copying them to a destination. 

You can run the script as a main program, or you can also call it from another script as a class instantiation. In the event of the latter, the main function you need to call is:

restructure_copy(copy_type, input_folder_path, output_directory, output_package_name=None, output_subfolder_name=None,do_fixity=None, do_delete=None, files_dict=None)

- copy_type is string value that is either 'archive,' delivery,' or 'one2one.'
- input_folder_path is a string value
- output_directory is a string value which designates just the directory destination, e.x. if you want the folder to be transferred to desk top, the output directory is /Desktop/ and not /Desktop/Foldername
- output_package_name is a string that needs to be defined for archive and delivery transfers; a one-to-one copy will assume the output folder name is the same as the origin folder name
- do_fixity performs fixity check for the transfer
- do_delete deletes the original folder
- files_dict follows the files_dict structure defined at that top of ingestremote.py, which stores checksum values and allows for circumvention of redundant checksum calculations. 

`dropboxuploadsession.py`

This script uploads a folder or file to dropbox. 

You can run the script as a main program, or you can call it from another script as a class instantiation. 

-- Add more info --

`remote_resource_space_ingest.php`

This script utilizes the resourcespace API. It uploads a package's window dub to resourcespace. It modifies the resourcespace asset metadata to include the filepath to the delivery address, a link to the dropbox upload, showname, studio type, and date.

The script is able to upload original files as alternative files, but that feature has been commented out because it's redundant and time consuming. The resourcespace filestore is on the same server as the archival packages (CUNYTVMEDIA). This creates a situation where files are duplicated on the same server, while relying on a time-consuming http request to make those copies.

Using the staticsync upload process is an alternative to consider, but relying on that will give less manipulability over the resourcespace folder structure unless significant edits are made to the source code.
